<h1>PhotoUploader App</h1>

<p>Welcome to the PhotoUploader app README! This app allows users to upload photos to a real-time database and securely view them through the app. Below, you'll find more details about the app features and how it works.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>User Authentication: The app uses Firebase Authentication to ensure that each user can only access their own uploaded photos.</li>
  <li>Photo Upload: Users can upload photos from their device to a real-time database.</li>
  <li>Secure Viewing: Users can securely view their uploaded photos through the app, even if they switch devices or reinstall the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<ol>
  <li>User Registration/Login: Users need to register or log in to access the app's features. This ensures that each user has their own secure space for photo uploads.</li>
  <li>Photo Upload: After logging in, users can upload photos from their device. Each photo is associated with the user's account and stored securely in the real-time database.</li>
  <li>Photo Viewing: Users can view their uploaded photos through the app's interface. The app retrieves the photos from the database and displays them to the user.</li>
</ol>
